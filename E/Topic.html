    Abortion is a complex and deeply divisive issue that has been at the center of ethical, legal, and societal debates for decades.
    At its core, abortion involves the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus can survive outside the womb.
    Proponents of abortion rights argue that a woman should have the autonomy to make decisions about her own body,
    including the choice to have an abortion. They emphasize the importance of access to safe and legal abortion services as a matter
    of reproductive freedom and healthcare. 


    On the other side of the debate, opponents of abortion, often referred to as pro-life advocates, argue that life begins at conception and,
    therefore, terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to taking a human life. They contend that society has a moral and legal 
    obligation to protect the rights and interests of the unborn child. This perspective is often rooted in religious, philosophical, 
    or ethical beliefs.


    The legal status of abortion varies widely around the world, with some countries permitting it under various circumstances, while others
    strictly restrict or ban it altogether. In many places, the debate over abortion continues to evolve, with discussions centered on issues 
    such as when life begins, the health and safety of pregnant individuals, and the role of government in regulating reproductive rights.
    Ultimately, the topic of abortion remains deeply polarizing, reflecting the diversity of perspectives and values held by individuals and
    societies globally.

Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. An abortion that
occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or "spontaneous abortion"; these occur in approximately 30% 
to 40% of all pregnancies. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced 
abortion, or less frequently "induced miscarriage". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced
abortion.
      
The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world Reasons include maternal 
health, an inability to afford a child, domestic violence, lack of support, feeling they are too young,
wishing to complete education or advance a career,and not being able or willing to raise a child conceived as a 
result of rape or incest.

When done legally in industrialized societies, induced abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine. In the 
United States, the risk of maternal mortality is 14 times lower after induced abortion than after childbirth. Unsafe 
abortions—those performed by people lacking the necessary skills, or in inadequately resourced settings—are responsible
 for between 5-13% of maternal deaths, especially in the developing world.
 
 However, medication abortions that are self-managed are highly effective and safe throughout the first trimester.
  Public health data shows that making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths.

   -- No woman can call herself free who does not control her own body.

   -- I've noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.
 
   -- I cannot understand anti-abortion arguments that centre on the sanctity of life.
      As a species we've fairly comprehensively demonstrated that we don't believe in the sanctity
      of life. The shrugging acceptance of war, famine, epidemic, pain and life-long poverty shows us that, 
      whatever we tell ourselves, we've made only the most feeble of efforts to really treat human life as sacred.

Around 73 million induced abortions take place worldwide each year.
Six out of 10 (61%) of all unintended pregnancies, and 3 out of 10 (29%) 
of all pregnancies, end in induced abortion.

Comprehensive abortion care is included in the list of essential health care services 
published by WHO in 2020. Abortion is a simple health care intervention that can be effectively
managed by a wide range of health workers using medication or a surgical procedure. In the
first 12 weeks of pregnancy, a medical abortion can also be safely self-managed by the pregnan
person outside of a health care facility (e.g., at home), in whole or in part. This requires
that the woman has access to accurate information, quality medicines and support from a trained
health worker (if she needs or wants it during the process).
        
Comprehensive abortion care includes the provision of information,
abortion management and post-abortion care. It encompasses care related
to miscarriage (spontaneous abortion and missed abortion), induced 
abortion (the deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means),
incomplete abortion as well as fetal death (intrauterine fetal demise). The information 
in this fact sheet focuses on care related to induced abortion.
