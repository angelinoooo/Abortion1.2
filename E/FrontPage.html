                        <h3> What's Abortion about?</h3>
                        <p>Abortion is the medical or surgical termination of a pregnancy, resulting in the removal of the fetus or embryo from the uterus. It's a highly sensitive and controversial topic that encompasses various aspects, including legal,
                            ethical, medical, and personal considerations.
                            <br><br> Here are some key points about abortion:
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Types of Abortion: </span>There are different types of abortion, depending on the gestational age of the pregnancy. These include medical abortion (usually done within the first 10 weeks using medication) and surgical
                            abortion (which can be performed at various stages of pregnancy).
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Legal Status:</span>The legality of abortion varies widely by country and region. Some places permit abortion under certain circumstances, while others have more restrictive laws. In some countries, abortion is legal
                            and accessible, while in others, it may be heavily restricted or even prohibited.
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Roe v. Wade:</span> In the United States, the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade in 1973 established a woman's legal right to have an abortion. However, this decision has been the subject of ongoing debate and legal
                            challenges.
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Ethical and Moral Debates:</span> Abortion is a subject of intense ethical and moral debate. Arguments often revolve around issues such as the rights of the fetus, a woman's right to choose, and the circumstances under
                            which abortion is considered acceptable.
                            <br><br>
                            <span>Reproductive Health:</span> Abortion is a component of reproductive health care. For some, it is a necessary option in cases of health risks, fetal abnormalities, or unplanned pregnancies. It can also be a sensitive and
                            difficult decision for individuals and couples to make.
